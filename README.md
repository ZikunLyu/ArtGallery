# ArtGallery
This is a web application designed for McGill art lovers to upload, share, rent and sell artworks and photos.   
User could only register through McGill email and there is really not many safety checks involved. This project is done by Yudi, Wenhao and me.   
This poject could not be used as a commercial application and for reuse purpose, the mongodb project need to be changed in thei project.
